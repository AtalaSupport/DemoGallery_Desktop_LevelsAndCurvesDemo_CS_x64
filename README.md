# Levels and Curves Demo


This is a simple Windows Forms application that highlights our Jp2Decoder and using it to view files in our WorkspaceViewer.

This demo was formerly called Jp2Viewer.

This is the C# version. We also have a [VB.NET version](https://github.com/AtalaSupport/DemoGallery_Desktop_Jpeg2000ViewerDemo_VB_x64)


## Licensing
This application as configured, requires a license for DotImage Document Imaging. Optionally the WinDemoHelperMethods class will include additional codecs such as PDF 

If you want to enable certain advanced Jp2Decoder features such as Pgorgressive Decompression, you'll need to license for Jpeg2000 and also uncomment the 2 relevant lines (included here for context) 

```csharp
InitializeComponent();
_jp2 = new Jp2Decoder();
//// NOTE you need a license for the Jpeg2000 Professional version for the progressive features
//_jp2.EnableProgressiveDecompression = true; 
//_jp2.ProgressiveImage += new ProgressiveImageEventHandler(jp2_ProgressiveImage); 
```

> **NOTE**
> In theory, you could use DotImage Photo or DotImage Photo Pro with the Jpeg2000 addon license. However, DotImage Document Imaging has included the Jpeg2000 (as well as Jbig2, DICOM, DWG and Forms Processing) for several years. If you're unsure of what you need, please [contact our sales team](mailto:sales@atalasoft.com).  


## SDK Dependencies
This app was built based on 2026.2.0.0. It targets .NET Framework 4.6.2 and was created in Visual Studio 2022. However, it's fairly backward compatible as distributed. If you start adding references, you can run into issues if you're using an especially outdated version of DotImage. It should also open and run equally well in Visual Studio 2026 without undue modification.  


### Using NuGet for SDK Dependencies
We do publish our SDK components to NuGet. We have chosen to base the demo on local installed SDK because this leads to much smaller applications (NuGet packages add a lot of overhead due to the way they're packaged and deployed, and many of our demos -- including this one -- are often used to reproduce issues that need to be submitted to support. Apps that use NuGet are often significantly larger and run up against our maximum support case upload size)

Still, if you wish to use NuGet for the dependencies instead of relying on locally installed SDK, you can.

- Take note of each of the references we've included:
    - Atalasoft.DotImage.dll
    - Atalasoft.DotImage.Lib.dll
    - Atalasoft.DotImage.Jpeg2000.dll
    - Atalasoft.Shared.dll
- Remove those referneces
- Open the NuGet Package Manger from `Tools -> NuGet Package Manager -> Manage NuGet Packages for this Solution`
- Browse for Atalasoft.DotImage.x64
- Install this package, and it will pull in DotImage Document Imaging (the base SDK)
- Browse for Atalasoft.DotImage.Jpeg2000.x64
- Install this package, and it will pull in the Jpeg2000 component

## Cloning
We recommend the following to ensure you clone with the required submodule

Example: git for windows
```bash
git clone https://github.com/AtalaSupport/DemoGallery_Desktop_Jpeg2000ViewerDemo_CS_x64.git DotPdfInvoiceTemplateDemo
```

If you've got DotImage 2026.2 installed and licensed, it should just build and run.
